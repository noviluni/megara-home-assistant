# Megara Home Assistant
This is an example of how to build a Home Assistant using [voice_assistant library](https://github.com/noviluni/voice_assistant).


### Demo

You can try the demo just typing: 

```bash
python3 demo.py
```
Of course, you need before to install the requirements.


### How to use

To use Megara, you just have to import the Assistant class from megara, in the same way you should do it using voice_assistant library.

```python3
from megara import Assistant
```

This Assistant class works in the same way that Assistant from [voice_assistant](https://github.com/noviluni/voice_assistant), but it implements automatically new behaviours coming from "modules."
